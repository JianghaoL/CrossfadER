# CrossfadER

## What is CrossfadER
CrossfadER is an audio tool that automates the process of hanlding looping sounds.

This tool is specifically built for game sound designers to help with shortening and improving their workflow. With this, sound designers no longer need to open their DAW to make a seamlessly looping sound! Just by clicking several buttons, the sound loops itself.

## How to Use
CrossfadER is designed to be user-friendly. There are only a few things to consider.

First, you will need to pick an auidio file by clicking the `Browse for File` button. The textblock next to the button will automatically show the selected file name.

Then, you can select both `Crossfade Time` and `Crossfade Mode` using the two dropdown button.

The default time is set to be `1s` and the defult mode is `Linear`.

The `Crossfade Time` needs to be shorter than the length of the given audio file. The program will give a warning if the chosen time is illegal.

Finally, you can choose whether to enter a new name for the exported file, and click the `Export Audio File` button. If you choose not to enter anything, the program will give the exported file a postfix formatted as `NameOfTheOriginalFile_crossfaded_(CROSSFADE_MODE).FileExtension`.
